            <br /> THE PREFACE<br /> <br />The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and&#160;conceal the artist is art's aim. The critic is he who can translate&#160;into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful<br />things.</p>
        <p>The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.<br />Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without&#160;being charming. This is a fault.</p>
        <p>Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the&#160;cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom&#160;beautiful things mean only beauty.</p>
        <p>There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well&#160;written, or badly written. That is all.</p>
        <p>The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing&#160;his own face in a glass.</p>
